# brawlTracker
 a stat tracking python script for specific players

 How to use :
 - run make_db.py to create the initial database
 - change the player_tags list to be the list of every player you want to track
- run main.py every day

  Voil√†, you have your database, that stores player total trophy, each player's individual braler trophy count, powerlevel, gadgets, gears and star powers, and stores the last 20 battles at the time of the script's launch (excluding duplicates) so if you want you can use this to see usage rate, win rate, etc..
